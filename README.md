Landslides are a serious issue, particularly in nations like Nepal, which has extensive Himalayas but no substantial technical developments. PKL (PKL Knows Landslide) is a Machine Learning-based project that lets you anticipate Landslides in advance. It is essentially an app that utilizes NASA data to forecast landslides and displays the most dangerous areas nearby.
